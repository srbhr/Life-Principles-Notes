# Principle 5. Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively

</br>

## First Order and Second Order Consequences
First order or first consequences are the temptations that we really want or sometimes these are the barriers that stand in our way.

For example exercising, first order outcomes of exercising:
- Pain.
- Muscle soreness.
- Longer recovery time.
- Feeling body pain throughout the day.
- Less energy to do other things.
  
But once that exercising is done repeatedly for a month or two. The below are the second order consequences of the same exercise:
- Muscle flexibility.
- High energy throughout the day.
- Feeling happy and good mental health.
- Ability to perform other tasks with agility and speed.
- More confidence.

</br>

_This is quite opposite to the first order outcomes._
But people overweigh the first order consequences too much and forget the second order consequences. 
Second order order consequences provide a contradicting and opposite result to first order consequences.

In general for many people, first order short sighted outcomes are the ones that causes major setbacks. Whereas delayed gratification, comes from thinking and measuring things in the long term.

A lot of extraordinary things in life are due to first order negative and second order positive outcomes. And it also requires a lot of mental training to get used to this thinking process and acting upon it. 

Ask yourself, after every stage of decision making, "And then what?".

First level thinking looks similar. Everyone can do the same, and reach the same conclusion. Road to out think people comes from second order thinking.

## On improving your ability to think
1. Ask yourself, "And then what?"
2. Think through time -- what do the consequences look like in 10 minutes, 10 hours, 10 days, 10 weeks, 10 months and 10 years?

Nature filters out on the first/second order consequences of things. Giving totally different outcomes to the same task for a long time. And even worst circumstances can be made better with the right approach.

## Internal Locus of Control
"While we are free to chose our actions, we are not free to chose the consequences of our actions."
~ Stephen Covey, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. 

Whatever circumstances life brings you. you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things beyond your control. 

We hate to be wrong, because it means that we need to re-asses ourselves, re do our comfortable lives and sometimes it takes an enormous amount of unlearning and re-learning. 

**Questions about second order effects.**
1. What are the most probable consequences of a system change you are considering?
2. What are the consequences of those consequences?
3. What can you do to minimize the probability and cost of unintended consequences?

## 10 Commandments of Super Forecasting:
1. Focus your time and effort on forecasts that will prove rewarding. 
2. Unpack problems to expose assumptions, catch mistakes, and correct biases.
3. Consider the larger category before looking at the particular case.
4. Revise your beliefs often and in small increments to reduce the risk of both over and under reacting to the news. 
5. Find merit in opposite viewpoints. 
6. Reject the illusions of certainty and learn to think in degrees of uncertainty. 
7. Avoid being either a blowhard or a waffler. Aim to be purely decisive. 
8. Learn from experience, whether success or failure. 
9. Use precision questioning to bring out the best in others and to let others bring out the best in you. 
10. Try, fail, analyze, and adjust. And try again. 
11. There are no universally correct commandments including these. Question everything.

## Biggest Threat to decision making is Harmful Emotions
Decision making needs to be done under clear skies. Where your thinking is not impacted by emotions, or any random circumstances. Rely on logic, reasoning, and common sense if you want to get the best picture of reality.
 Also, Decision making is a two step process:
 1. Learning all the important details. 
 2. Making decision based on data (learned details.)

Do not make decisions before calculations based on evidence. (That is called assumptions.)

</br>

## Synthesize the situation at hand
Simplify your decision-making process by removing all of the superfluous information. Synthesize your current situation, i.e., identify the factors that are important to your ongoing decision-making process.

**Don't believe everything you hear**. 

Keep in mind the **rate of change of things** and the **relationship between them**.

**Be Imprecise:** Use the concept of By-and-Large (When everything is considered about a situation or overall)

In the long run, prioritization beats efficiency.

**Be an im-perfectionist:** This in terms of uncertainty as well. Perfectionists tend to spend a lot of time on little differences at the margins on the expense of important things. Therefore, it's very important to see things on a bigger scale as well. 

</br>

### Everything Looks Bigger Up Close
In all aspects of life what is happening today seems like a much bigger deal than it will appear in retrospect. Understand this, right now things or situations may seem very important but in the long run. It might turn to be just another small thing of the past. 
**Step back, gain perspective and sometimes defer a decision until time passes.**

### New is Overvalued to Great
It is smarter to choose the great over to the new (or the next big thing.)

## Make your decisions as expected value calculations.
-   Think of each decision as a bet with a probability and a reward for being right and a probability and a penalty for being wrong.
-   Sometimes it’s smart to take a chance even when the odds are overwhelmingly against you if the cost of being wrong is negligible relative to the reward that comes with the slim chance of being right. “It never hurts to ask.”
-   The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don’t have any cons at all.

</br>


## Prioritize by weighing the value of additional information against the cost of not deciding. 
-   All of your must-dos must be done before you do any of your “like-to-dos”
-   You won’t have time to deal with unimportant things, which is better than not having time to deal with important things.
- **It takes a lot of time to learn and master these principles. And make them a part of your routine.**
- When determining the size or complexity of a new habit ask yourself,"What can I stick to -- even on my worst day?" _Master the art of showing up, and then advance._
</br>

## Use Principles 
-   When Researching strategies, emphasize patterns over stories.
    -   One person succeeding means nothing.  
    -   One hundred people succeeding is a signal.
-   Slow down your thinking so you can note the criteria you are using to make your decision.
-   Write the criteria down as a principle.
-   Think about those criteria when you have an outcome to assess, and refine them before the next “one of those” comes along.
