<h1 align="center"> Principle 3. Be Radically Open Minded </h1>

</br>

Two big factors that halter decision making process. 
1. Ego
2. Blind Spots

Understanding the effects of the above two can lead to better decision making. 

</br>

## Ego Barrier
The Subliminal defense mechanism that makes it hard to accept your mistakes and weaknesses. 

The Fight between the **Logical You** vs **Emotional You**
It's like attack dogs. They want to fight even if their higher level self wants to figure out. This happens to all the people. 

Therefore, avoid taking action, or making decision when you are emotional(happy, angry, sad, etc.)

</br>

## Understand the blind spot barriers

</br>
What are blind spots in decision making?

Areas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately. As we're guided to see things in our own way, we might miss out on the things which are important but we don't know about them. 

The Problem: People don't like to see themselves as having blind spots/weaknesses. (Which is a problem in itself. Understanding Ego Barrier is important here.)

Failure to benefit from others thinking doesn't just occur when disagreements arise. This causes a loop in which you will keep running over and over until you understand and learn. 

</br>

### Adapting to the blind spot barriers:
1. Teaching your brain how you want to work through discipline and practice. 
2. Using compensating mechanisms e.g. programmed reminders. 
3. Relying on the help of others who are strong where you are weak. 

Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person's fatal flaws. Had it been fixed, would have led to a wonderful outcome.

## Radical Open-Mindedness
The ability to effectively explore different points of views and different possibilities without letting  your ego barrier or your blind spots come in your way.

1. You might not know what is the best possible outcome for you. 
2. Decision making is a two-step process.
	1. Take all the necessary information.
	2. Make decisions. 
3. **Don't worry about looking good, worry about achieving your goal.**
4. You cannot put out without taking in. 
5. To understand perspective of others, suspend your judgement. Empathize and only then you can properly evaluate another point of view. 
6. You are looking for the best answer. Not the best answer you can come up with yourself. 

**Always seek which view is right and then proceed with it. Even the experts makes mistakes and it pays to be radically open minded.**
