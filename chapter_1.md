<H1 align="center"> Principle 1. Embrace Reality and Deal with it </H1>


It's really important not to let our biases stand in our way of our objectivity. To get good results we need to be analytical rather than emotional.

Realize that, **Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual.** Nature seem to define **good** as what is good for the **whole** & optimizes for it. As compared and opposite to our humane definition of good or bad.

To be "good", something must **operate consistently** with the laws of reality and contribute to evolution of the whole. That is what is most awarded.

## Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. 
Take viruses for example. 
- They can change forms, improve and make new strains. 
- Something we experienced really, really well.

</br>

## Materialistic things are the baits that evolve us. 
Chasing after the things we really like or want (goals and desires) forces us to evolve. 
**It's the evolution and not the reward that matters to us and those around us.**

## Pain + Reflection = Progress. 

**No Pain, No Gain**: While we don't like pain. Everything nature made has a purpose. It alerts us and help direct us towards something (maybe meaningful/important). There's no avoiding pain, especially if you are going after ambitious goals.

## Pain Avoidance 

**People deeply hate and avoid pain.** Their basic instinct is to avoid pain, create work around and try to live a pain free life. But understanding that, **if you are not feeling pain, are not sad**, aren't feeling low/depressed **that doesn't means that you are happy**, motivated, energetic, mentally stable, or progressing. 

People fail to understand this, and take this low-life perspective to live life. Starting at your phone screen is one way to avoid pain, eating a lot is another. But that does not means, you are doing something better or are more productive. 

When you are going after big things in life, you can **NEVER** avoid pain. You can try to postpone it and when it you have to deal with later. It comes with the interest. Best way to handle pain would be to tackle it then and there only. And never delay it. 

Feel lucky to feel pain as it's a good sign (referring to as mental pain of hardships). Develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect upon it rather than avoid it. Which later on leads to rapid learning and progress.
