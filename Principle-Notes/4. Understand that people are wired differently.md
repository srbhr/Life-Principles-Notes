# Principle 4. Understand that people are wired very differently. 

Because of the different ways people are wired. We all experience reality in different ways and this becomes the basis of human nature. 

People have different:
- Needs
- Goals
- Aspirations
- Friends & Family
- Environment
- Upbringing

The above factors motivates different people to operate differently.

Understanding people requires radical open mindedness. The brain battles between logic and emotion. It goes from Amygdala (emotional + subconscious) vs Prefrontal Cortex (logical + conscicous ) part of the brain. Controlling this fight allows you to get what we want out of the game.


Whenever you can, reconcile your feelings and thinking. 

Most contstant struggle is between feeling and thinking. 

Habits allows us to perform. Which makes it the most powerful tool in your brains toolbox. Therefore, prefer to build habits as they automate your daily process e.g. using pain to trigger quality reflections.
