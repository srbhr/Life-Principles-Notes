# Principle 1
# Embrace Reality and Deal with it
---
It's really important not to let our biases stand in our way of our objectivity. To get good results we need to be analytical rather than emotional.

Realise that,
> **Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual.** Nature seem to define **good** as what is good for the **whole** & optimises for it. As compared to our individual/humane good.


To be "good", something must <mark>**operate consistently**</mark> with the laws of reality and contribute to evolution of the whole. That is what is most awarded. 

##### Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. 
- Take viruses for example. 
	- They can change forms, improve and make new strains. 
	- Something we experienced really, really well.

#### Materialistic things are the baits that evolve us. 
Chasing after the things we really like or want (goals and desires) forces us to evolve. 
<mark>It's the evolution and not the reward</mark> that matters to us and those around us.
