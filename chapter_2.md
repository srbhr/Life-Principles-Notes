<h1 align="center"> Principle 2. Use the 5 Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life </h2>

The 5 step process to get the most out of anything:
1. Have clear goals.
2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of you achieving those goals. 
3. Accurately diagnose those problems to get at their root cause. 
4. Design plans that will get you around them.
5. Do what is necessary to push these designs to results.

_Work -> Fail -> Assess -> Learn -> Try -> Fail (Again) -> Re-Asses -> Get it done!_ (Do this on repeat.)

<br>

All these 5 steps need to be executed well & in order to be successful. 

When setting goals, just set goals. Don't think on how you will achieve them. 

When diagnosing problems, just diagnose problems. Focus on the step you are trying to achieve. 

**Blurring leads to suboptimal outcomes.**

## One question, that you will face in your life very often.
Question: **"I don't have all the skills I need to succeed?"**
Answer: **"Don't worry about it, because that is true for everyone, and for everything new you want to try."**

You just need to know:
- When those skills are needed. 
- Where you can get them.
This will allow you to play the game with a calm and unstoppable centeredness in the face of adversity.

## Push yourself task to completion. 

Great planners who don't execute their plans go nowhere. And when you feel yourself losing sight of your goals, stop and ask yourself "Why?". Lose sight of this why and you will lose sight of your goals. 

Everyone has at least one big problem that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it. Therefore, taking steps:
1. Pushing yourself to results. 
2. Focus on **key** result areas. 
3. Understand that things (actions, plans, roadmaps, etc.) and their results of these actions take time. And you can only get there by deliberate practice. 

Therefore, **consistency is key**.
